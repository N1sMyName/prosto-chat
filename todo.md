this app is ugly and it is not working as expected

goal is to show demo of possible app that utilizes ai to answer chat for human, it read 
previous chat and answer accordingly(or it train itself continuously for every chat user poses)

What need to be done:
 - choose and setup ci/cd pipeline
 - fuck python, use instead c# or javascript
 - rewrite backend into any of above
 - containerize whole thing to work from signle or multiiple containers in case some one would like to run it localy
 - thing how to deploy whole this thing to remote
